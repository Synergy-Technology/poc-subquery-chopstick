# Problem Statement
The issue with the testing the subquery require tremendous effort and waiting time for the test to be carried out.

Pulling data from the blockchain , and having many events and extrinsics to be tested is also not possible if to be carried out in CI/CD 

Having a blockchain which closely replicate the actual blockchain will be a great help in testing the subquery.


# Chopstick approach
Using the Chopstick, we can test the subquery in a much faster way.


# How ?

1. Containerize the chopstick
2. Test the subquery using the chopstick
